# Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees

This codebase trains the models analyzed in the paper: Weakly Supervised Disentanglement with Guarantees.

In addition to installing the requirements, make sure to follow the instructions from [disentanglement_lib](https://github.com/google-research/disentanglement_lib) to download the necessary datasets.

To run this code with a choice of default config (for complete-change-pairing on dsprites), simply run
```
python3 main.py
```
